.SH DESCRIPTION
tjreport summarises the information in a journal file generated by a
.B TET
based
.B LSB
test suite or checker using the
.B tetj
emulation toolkit.
.PP
It is also capable of loading the results from all the test suites into a
.B Mysql
database. If you want to do this you will need to also install the \fBDBI\fR
and \fBDBD MySQL Perl\fR modules.
.PP
If processing a single journal file with no options, tjreport attempts
to retrieve information on granted waivers for that version of the test
suite across the network using the
.B wget
utility.  Retrieved waiver information is stored in the file
.BI waivers- test.version.arch
in the current directory, where
.I test.version.arch
is a triple describing the test.
Use of the
.B \(miw
option overrides networked waiver information retrieval in
favor of using an existing local file.
.PP
If a second journal file is supplied, report on tests
whose result differs between the two runs. In this case
none of the waiver processing is done.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode (show error messages)
.TP
\fB\-w\fR \fIwaiver file\fR

.SH "EXAMPLES"
To display a summary of all tests which failed in the journal file named
\fIjournal\fR:

        \fBtjreport journal\fR

To display the results of all of the tests in the journal file:

        \fBtjreport -d journal \fR

To display the difference in test results stored in two journal files:

        \fBtjreport journal1 journal2\fR

To display the results of all tetst which failed but take into account
the waiver file \fIwaived.txt\fR:
        
        \fBtjreport -w waived.txt journal \fR

To load the results into a MySQL database named \fIlsbtest\fR with
some results from a \fIDebian 3.0\fR distribution:

        \fBtjreport -b lsbtest -e Debian -r 3.0 journal \fR
