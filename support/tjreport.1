.SH NAME
tjreport \- TET Journal Report Summariser
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tjreport
[\fI-h\fR] [\fI-d\fR] [\fI-u username\fR] [\fI-p password\fR] [[\fI-b db_name\fR] [\fI-o host\fR] [\fI-o host\fR] [-e vendor_name] [-r version]] [-w FILE] JOURNAL_FILE [JOURNAL_FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
tjreport summarises the information in the journal file generated by
the
.B TET
based
.B LSB
test suites. If it is passed two journal files
it displays the tests which report different results.

It is also capable of loading the results from all the test suites into a
.B Mysql
database. If you want to do this you will need to also install the \fBDBI\fR
and \fBDBD MySQL Perl\fR modules.

If processing a single journal file with no options, tjreport attempts
to retrieve information on granted waivers for that version of the test
suite across the network using the
.B wget
utility.  Retrieved waiver information is stored in the file
.B waivers.txt 
in the current directory.
Use of the
.B \(miw
option overrides networked waiver information retrieval.
